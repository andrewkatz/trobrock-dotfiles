# Dotfiles

You probably shouldn't use this if you aren't me. But go for it if you want...

## Commands

bin/install: This will install all the dotfiles with stow.
**Note: this will overwrite anything that already exists, so you better have everything backed up!**

bin/diff: This shows what symlinks are missing.
